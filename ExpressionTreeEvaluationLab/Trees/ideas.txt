-What about traversing a binary tree by splitting both sides into a separate execution thread
 of the cpu? Or what about using 'os.fork()' and 'forking' each side of the tree?
-Having each side of the tree be traversed on its own cpu-core (or cpu-thread?) ???

-Spend some time looking at/practice writing the 'insertion_sort' algo
 --It is a way to implement an 'ordered' data-structure, while inserting elements
   --essentially performing 2 super-useful function, just at the same time.

-Look into using/implementing the 'heap_sort' algorithm
  --O(n log n) time
  --faster than lots of other sorting algos.
