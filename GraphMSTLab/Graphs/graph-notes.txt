""" Basic implementation of a graph. Uses will be for storing data, in which the data
    is usually a name-identifier, with a value.
    Using the Graph will allow fairly fast lookups of data (when paired w/proper traveral-
    algos) and will allow large systems of data to be built.

    Could ideally be used for/with the "Dictionairies" lab, which allegedly will be used
    in future labs.
